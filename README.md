this app was a failed attempt to create a sysmodule like systweak lol. 

however i gave up and left the function to list the title ids and games installed on the switch. 

i thought this would be usefull for when you need to install cheats an you need the title Id. 

you now dont have to look up the title id online but instead use this app to list all games and title ids 

hope you found this usefull. 

# How to use

simply download the switch.zip and extract the switch folder to the root of the sd card. 
alternatively you can download the switch.zip and open the switch folder then copyt the Title-Id-Lister.nro to the switch folder.
